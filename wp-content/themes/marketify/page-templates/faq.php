				<p class="faq-question">What Is my resource’s “Thumbnail Image”?</p>
				<p>The thumbnail image is the image that will represent your resource throughout the site, and will show up in search results, on your public Room page, and elsewhere. We recommend a JPEG image  840px wide and 525px tall, or larger, and a width-to-height ratio of 1.6:1. You should choose or create an image that communicates the focus and style of your resource, and encourages other users to check it out!

				<ul>
					<li>Delete unnecessary images within your documents.</li>
