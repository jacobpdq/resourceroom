Our aim is to provide a single location for you to conveniently source high quality, relevant, and current educational resources based on Canadian education and provincial curriculum expectations. </p>
              
              <p>We hope that increased collaboration among Canadian teachers will benefit our system and our students.

Visit our FAQ to see how you can apply for a donation!</p>
              
              <h3 id="mission">Mission</h3>
              <p>Our mission is to create a useful tool for Canadian teachers in order to support educational practices in Canadian classrooms. With improved opportunities for sharing and collaboration, less time will be spent recreating the wheel and teachers will be able to tackle the important stuff – differentiation, accommodation, and attention to diverse student needs. We hope to support teachers by freeing up their time and allowing them to focus their energy and passion on the things that matter most: students and school communities. </p>
              <p>Furthermore, we commit to supporting Canadian teachers by funding programs and projects that support Canadian education. </p>
              <p>Not only does Resource Room support teachers through collaboration, it also functions as an opportunity for teachers to earn a secondary income by sharing the work that they are proud of. Teachers put hard work into developing resources and we believe that they don't simply belong in a binder, in a drawer, or on a flash drive. We value your hard work and think that hard work should literally pay off! </p>
              
              <h3 id="vision">Vision</h3>
              <p>We envision a collaborative community of Canadian educators who come together to share their best practices, top resources, and personal experiences. Making a space for this community to thrive raises the bar for the standard of teaching in Canadian classrooms.</p>
              <p>Goodbye textbooks. Goodbye “1 size fits all” lessons. By sharing our professionally developed resources, we will now be able to direct our energy toward adapting, modifying, differentiating, and accommodating lessons to suit each individual learner.</p>
              <p>By supporting one another, we collectively support our students!</p>
              
              <h3 id="what-sets-us-apart">What Sets Us Apart</h3>
              <p>How is Resource Room different from other educational resource marketplaces, you ask?</p>
              <p>We opt for <em>relevance</em>. In Canada, our educational system is provincially regulated. That means Grade 5 Social Studies in British Columbia We opt for relevance. In Canada, our educational system is provincially regulated. That means Grade 5 Social Studies in British Columbia is not necessarily the same as Grade 5 Social Studies in Ontario. We offer an organized marketplace, created specifically for Canadian teachers, with provincial curriculum in mind. When you search for resources, we want you to be assured that they meet requirements and can be successfully applied in your classroom.</p>
              <p>We choose <em>quality over quantity</em>. By limiting our marketplace to Canadian teachers, we narrow the buying and selling community. The Resource Room is a marketplace of high quality resources that are used in real Canadian classrooms. To monitor the quality of resources available in our marketplace, we use a peer review system, which allows teachers to rate and review resources. Low-quality resources can be flagged and reported and together we can ensure that our community is top notch.</p>
              <p>We urge educators to <em>keep with the times</em>. Print resources risk becoming outdated and irrelevant too quickly. Our digital database provides an opportunity for the most current and relevant resources to be shared. Keeping up with new research, best practices, and current classroom technology is increasingly important and we help make it accessible!</p>
              <p>We support <em>Canadian education</em>. Beyond creating a platform for resource sharing and up to date Canadian educational content, we put our money where our mouth is by donating 10% of quarterly profits to programs and projects that benefit Canadian education. We are Canadian and are invested in the success of Canadian education.</p>

              <h3 id="why-buy">Why Buy?</h3>
              <p>As teachers, we work hard. All day we focus our energy on our supporting the learning and development of our students. Our breaks are often filled with planning, marking, prepping, mediating, coaching, and professional development. And we don’t stop there; many of us go home and spend all night marking and creating new and engaging lessons for our students.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, many of us still don’t feel like we’re accomplishing everything that we wish we could. With some classrooms exceeding 30 students, it is hard to make sure that each student is accommodated for. By purchasing lesson plans that were created by our colleagues, we have a foundation that we are able to adapt to our diverse classroom compositions.</p>
              <p><em>New to teaching?</em> We know we don’t want to teach straight from the textbook, but we also hear horror stories about the exhaustion of creating our resource stock from scratch. Get support from colleagues that have been in your shoes. Gain ideas, insight, and years of experience within the Resource Room marketplace.</p>

              <p>Simple – hard work should pay off! You put a lot of time and energy into creating unique and engaging units and lessons for your students.
